# CMUCal

**CMUCal** is a comprehensive web application designed to eliminate the friction of managing scattered academic schedules by bringing all CMU academic resources into one place.
- It features an intuitive frontend built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, a robust backend powered by Flask, and an efficient scraping system developed in Python.
- Through seamless Google Calendar integration, it unifies users' existing calendars with
lectures, recitations, office hours, and academic support events.
- Planned features include integrations with Handshake and TartanConnect, as well as
community-driven event discovery through crowdsourced submissions and upvote/downvote mechanisms.
